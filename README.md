## Machine Learning 

- **`Supervised learning`**: Supervised learning algorithms are a class of machine learning algorithms that use previously-labeled data to learn its features, so they can classify similar but unlabeled data.
- **`Linear and logistic regression`**: Using features of the input data to predict a value
- **`Support vector machines`**: SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for classification. 
- **`Decision Trees`**: A decision tree creates a classifier in the form of a tree.
- **`Naive Bayes`**: Naive Bayes is different from many other machine learning algorithms.
- **`Unsupervised learning`**: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning algorithm used to draw inferences from datasets      consisting of input data without labeled responses.
- **`K-means`**: K-means is a clustering algorithm that groups the elements of a dataset into k distinct clusters.
- **`Reinforcement learning`**: Reinforcement is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. 
- **`Q-learning`**: Q-learning is an off-policy temporal-difference reinforcement learning algorithm.
